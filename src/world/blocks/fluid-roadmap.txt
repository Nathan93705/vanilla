Minecraft Fluids:
  - ✅ Either the block is a flowing or source fluid block, spreads by its own
  - If the source block cant spread horizontally
    	the flow will try to pathfind a fall in a 5-4 radius after reaching the floor
  - ✅ If the source block can spread horizontally it will do it
  - ✅ A fluid can spread infitelly vertically, being this the main advantage
  - ✅ The fluid max spread without fall (for water) is 7 blocks
  - ✅ Fluid distance is measured by manhattan distance
  - The flowing should start to flow only if:
    ✅ Its on the ground
    * The pathfinding condition is not fullfiled
  - minecraft:water Depth > 8:
    - Full block
  - TODOs:
    ✅ Add fluid collisions
    ✅ Add fluid viscostiy
    ✅ Flow doesnt let blocks to be placed
    * Fluid retraction (Remove flow after flow source elimination or flow unable to reach)
    * Flow joining
    ✅ Full block creation
    * Flow movement
    * General cleanup (end)
